# 100 Notebooks to learn Python
I've made these notebooks to learn Python myself and now I can share it with the world. 

It is, however a work in progress. It will take the rest of 2023 to create a great set of quality notebooks to learn how to program in Python

It's divided into seven categories:

1. Basics
2. Intermediate
3. Machine learning & Deep Learning (Computer Vision, NLP etc)
4. Big Data & Data engineering (data protocols, integration etc)
5. Audio
6. Creative Coding & miscellanious


### Learning paths
You can create your own learning path if you like. 
For example this is a learning path to learn Computer Vision
