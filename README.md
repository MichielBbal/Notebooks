# Notebooks
Here you can find my Jupyter Notebooks. I've made these notebooks to learn Python and to collect code snippets. 

The truth is: it's still a mess. Some notebooks are useful, others are just some examples of (lines of) code. I'll clean it up bit by bit.

It's divided into four categories:

1. Basics
2. Intermediate
3. Machine / Deep Learning 
4. Applications
