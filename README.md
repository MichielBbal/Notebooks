# Notebooks
Here you can find my Jupyter Notebooks. I've made these notebooks to learn Python and to collect code snippets. 

The awful truth is: it's still a mess. Some notebooks are useful, others are just some examples of (lines of) code. I'll clean it up bit by bit.

It's divided into seven categories:

1. Basics
2. Intermediate
3. Deep learning, mostly Computer Vision
4. Notebooks about integration
5. Audio
6. Misc
7. Work for the HvA (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences)
